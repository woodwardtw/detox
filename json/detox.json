Tech companies like Zoom, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook saw their profits grow as we turned to their platforms for work and academic continuity, social connections, shopping, and other services. In the education sector, companies like Canvas and Blackboard (two Learning Management Systems) <a href=\"https:\/\/philonedtech.com\/massive-increase-in-lms-and-synchronous-video-usage-due-to-covid-19\/\">saw their user bases explode<\/a>, and ed tech startups raised a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edsurge.com\/news\/2021-01-13-a-record-year-amid-a-pandemic-us-edtech-raises-2-2-billion-in-2020\">record-breaking $2.2 billion<\/a> in venture and private equity capital. Meanwhile, school systems and universities slashed budgets and laid off staff to stay afloat financially.<\/p>\n<p>My concern is not just that we shifted our resources en masse to technology platforms, though yes, I have huge concerns about that. Educational institutions spent large amounts of money purchasing new software or extending existing contracts in the name of \u201cacademic continuity\u201d&#8211;but the continuity of what, exactly? Platforms like Zoom, <a href=\"https:\/\/hackeducation.com\/2020\/04\/30\/surveillance\">originally designed for workplaces<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/hackeducation.com\/2020\/04\/30\/surveillance\">re-inscribed<\/a> teacher-centered models of education and inequitable approaches to learning. Though the narrative we tell about digital platforms\u2019 role in education is one of promise and innovation, what Audrey Watters calls the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/hackeducation.com\/2020\/06\/21\/imaginary\">ed tech imaginary<\/a>,\u201d the reality is that the use of these technologies, particularly during the pandemic, have <a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/digital-literacy\/digital-detox-2021-2-covid-and-equitable-access-to-education\/\">further exacerbated issues of inequity<\/a> and problematic pedagogical practices. <a href=\"https:\/\/hackeducation.com\/2020\/11\/05\/trauma\">As Watters writes<\/a>, \u201ced-tech isn&#8217;t necessarily progressive pedagogically or politically\u2026 much of ed-tech is built on behaviorism, and its most famous advocate, you&#8217;ll recall, B. F. Skinner, famously did not believe in freedom. When it&#8217;s built to serve oppressive pedagogies and discriminatory institutions \u2014 when it&#8217;s built with a belief that students shouldn&#8217;t have agency but rather should be engineered and optimized, then ed-tech&#8230;is not the answer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the ways in which platforms shape our pedagogy, I have concerns about the longer-term impact of our increased reliance on digital platforms, as we give these extractive and even exploitative technologies more access to our daily lives and to our educational processes. Platforms profit from our data&#8211;data that are collected when we interact with the platform or with others on the platform, or data that platforms collect about us from other sources (our purchasing records, voting records, and other activity records). According to Nick Srnicek, author of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wiley.com\/en-us\/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862\">Platform Capitalism<\/a>, \u201csuppression of privacy is at the heart of [platforms\u2019] business models\u201d (see also Shoshana Zuboff\u2019s scholarship on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/2019\/oct\/04\/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy\">Surveillance Capitalism<\/a>; for a poignant look into the interplay of platform capitalism and Silicon Valley\u2019s tech companies, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/us.macmillan.com\/books\/9780374719760\">Anna Wiener\u2019s Uncanny Valley<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Citing Srnicek\u2019s scholarship on platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/postpandemicuniversity.net\/2021\/01\/18\/platform-capitalism-and-the-future-of-international-education\/\">Martin Henry writes<\/a> that \u201cplatform capitalism has significant internal fissures that inevitably lead to a disembodying of student and teacher and a tendency for the university to move away from their role as nurturers of student learning and growth and guardians of knowledge, towards a position where students and teachers are seen within the data gathered around them as crops to be harvested.\u201d Rather than resisting this treatment of students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 data, schools often justify extractive platforms for the purposes of assessment (e.g. learning analytics), community (e.g., social media communities), academic integrity (e.g., plagiarism software, online proctoring), security (social media monitoring), and more &#8212; intentionally or unintentionally buying into the suppression of privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to the popular adage that <i>kids these days don\u2019t care about privacy<\/i>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edweek.org\/technology\/teens-are-worried-about-online-privacy-what-schools-should-do-to-protect-them\/2018\/05\">young people are rightfully concerned<\/a> about how platforms\u2019 extraction\/use of their data impacts them, including (maybe especially) platforms they encounter in their schools. In <a href=\"https:\/\/middleburycampus.com\/53656\/opinion\/facebook-campus-is-not-middleburys-friend\/\">his excellent article for the Middlebury Campus<\/a>, Jake Gaughan denounces the College\u2019s adoption of Facebook Campus in the fall of 2020, noting that the College\u2019s use of the platform to connect students points Facebook\u2019s exploitative data practices directly at Middlebury students. He adds:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@middlebury added a claim that \u201c[Facebook Campus] is 100% designed for students\u201d before linking to marketing material from fb.com. This is a lie. Facebook Campus is no more designed for students than an oil rig is designed for the Earth. Facebook needs our user data to profit, and they are willing to go to great lengths to extract it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now is the time to re-evaluate our individual and institutional relationships with digital platforms and to demand more engagement with these issues at the federal and state policy level. The United States is the only member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/11\/02\/sunday-review\/data-protection-privacy.html\">that does not have a Data Protection Agency<\/a> and the US Department of Education provides little guidance on student data privacy (and most of that limited guidance focuses on FERPA compliance), leaving policy decision making in the hands of local schools and institutions of higher education. Now is the time to create a culture of privacy that cares for student data and educates students about privacy, and act to recognize how technologies justified as a response to the pandemic need to be reconsidered in light of significant concerns about student privacy. As we re-evaluate platforms in light of privacy concerns, we also have an opportunity to think carefully about how these technologies support &#8211; or get in the way &#8211; of student-centered learning.<\/p>\n<h3>Take Action<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Personal Action<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Complete <a href=\"https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/home\">Tactical Tech\u2019s Data Detox<\/a>, focusing on strategies to understand and better manage data collected by platforms (e.g., <a href=\"https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/privacy\/degooglise\/\">Degooglise your life<\/a>; <a href=\"https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/privacy\/essentials#step-4\">Control your smartphone data<\/a>; and <a href=\"https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/privacy\/browser\">Fortify your browser<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Explore and use privacy-oriented platforms, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.signal.org\/\">Signal for chat and messaging<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/\">DuckDuckGo for searching<\/a>.

Kat Holmes says at the start of her book Mismatch&#8211;one of the key texts for our class&#8211;that noticing exclusion is a prerequisite for more inclusive approaches to design, so we spent much of that first week focused on helping students to hone their noticing skills. Students in our class hone their noticing by reading texts and exploring course materials that make visible some of the design exclusions of which they were not aware. For example, in our <a href=\"https:\/\/design-justice.pubpub.org\/pub\/0v6035ye\/release\/1\">Design Justice text<\/a>, Sasha Costanza-Chock shares a story that highlights the exclusion of trans folks in binary systems like airport millimeter wave scanners. We also asked students to begin noticing exclusions in designs in their environment around them and share those designs on our Exclusionary Design Wall of Shame, created using a tool called Padlet.<\/p>\n<p>Noticing is a practice of where and how we focus our attention on the world around us, including the digital world. Sasha Costanza-Chock\u2019s story of exclusion generated much discussion among the students in our class, particularly around the idea that it is hard to notice exclusion if you\u2019re not the person being excluded. As Peggy McIntosh points out in <a href=\"https:\/\/psychology.umbc.edu\/files\/2016\/10\/White-Privilege_McIntosh-1989.pdf\">White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack<\/a>, when systems are built for you (the privileged user) and when systems benefit you (the privileged user), it takes a concerted effort to notice the impact of those systems on people for whom they were not built. How can we, when coming from a place of privilege, begin to notice the impact of design intention on others? While some argue that empathy is a first step, <a href=\"https:\/\/jesshmitchell.com\/inclusive-what-is-it\/\">Jess Mitchell argues<\/a> that empathy might be \u201ctoo big an ask for many. I think we need to begin with acknowledging personhood and build from there.\u201d She suggests that we start with curiosity, by asking questions: what is failing? What isn\u2019t working for someone? In the digital world, curiosity might involve asking who are digital platforms built for and for whom are they not built? For whom is this platform failing? And, who is most at risk from digital platforms\u2019 extractive data practices and algorithmic drivers?<\/p>\n<p>Noticing alone is not sufficient to become a more inclusive designer (or, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diffuse_design\">if you do not see yourself as a designer<\/a>, a more inclusive person). <a href=\"https:\/\/design-justice.pubpub.org\/pub\/0v6035ye\/release\/1\">Costanza-Chock argues<\/a> that framing exclusion solely as a design problem decouples it from \u201cconsideration of systemic, persistent, ongoing forms of oppression under the matrix of domination&#8230;the ways that algorithms are used by various actors and institutions to reproduce white supremacist capitalist heteropatriarchy and settler colonialism is reduced to a critique of \u2018algorithmic bias.\u2019\u201d Noticing exclusion cannot focus solely on the intentions and impacts of single designs\/designers; it must also examine the situatedness of that exclusion within broader and systemic exclusions. For example, in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dukeupress.edu\/dark-matters\">Dark Matters<\/a>, Simone Browne centers the conditions of blackness in surveillance, so that \u201crather than seeing surveillance as something inaugurated by new technologies, such as automated facial recognition or unmanned autonomous vehicles (or drones), to see it as ongoing is to insist that we factor in how racism and antiblackness undergird and sustain the intersecting surveillances of our present order.\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/design-justice.pubpub.org\/pub\/0v6035ye\/release\/1\">Costanza-Chock writes<\/a>, \u201cif we never zoom out to the big picture, then we never take on the larger structures that constantly militate toward the reproduction of designed inequality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How do we hone and situate our noticing, and direct it toward making a more inclusive world? In his digital detox <a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/digital-literacy\/digital-detox-2020-3-practicing-noticing-in-the-attention-economy\/\">Inhabiting Third Spaces &amp; The Art of Noticing<\/a>, Bob Cole quotes Jenny Odell: \u201cif it\u2019s attention (deciding what to pay attention to) that makes our reality, regaining control of it can also mean the discovery of new worlds and new ways of moving through them\u201d (How To Do Nothing, p.94). Ruha Benjamin suggests that we must resist the frenetic and attention-seeking pull of the digital world, shifting from \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d (an early Facebook motto) to \u201cmove slower and empower people\u201d (Race After Technology, p. 17). We must choose, over and over again, to direct our attention to the exclusions that are all around us; to intentionally listen to folks who are typically marginalized by design, whether informally through hearing and reading their perspectives, or through more formal processes, like participatory design approaches including Inclusive Design and Design Justice that invite marginalized folks to the table as co-designers (and sometimes co-owners) of the design process.<\/p>\n<p>Even if we do not see ourselves as designers (though Kat Holmes argues that \u201canyone who has ever solved a problem is, in a certain sense, a designer,\u201d Mismatch, p. 47), our willingness to notice exclusions, and better yet work to counteract those exclusions, can help break cycles of exclusion in the designs of our political systems, built environment, educational systems, and yes, digital platforms and tools.<\/p>\n<h3>Take Action<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Practice curiosity and hone your

href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/digital-literacy\/digital-detox-2021-2-covid-and-equitable-access-to-education\/\">students have unequal access to their learning<\/a>, which has been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. As faculty and school administrators realized the scale of the disruption to students\u2019 learning during Spring 2020, some called for rethinking grading policies and practices, as Pamela Chui Kadakia and Allan A. Bradshaw noted in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/advice\/2020\/05\/06\/changes-instructors-should-consider-administering-and-grading-exams-during-covid\">their Inside Higher Ed article<\/a>. Indeed, much as the pandemic has raised a broader awareness of equity issues in education, it has also shone a light on the decades-long debate over grading, another example of the ways in which the pandemic\u2019s impact on education has amplified inequities that have always existed.<\/p>\n<p>Critiques of grading, one of the most taken-for-granted practices in institutionalized teaching and learning, are not new. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfiekohn.org\/article\/case-grades\/\">Alfie Kohn\u2019s research from the late 1990s<\/a> argues that grading has had a negative impact of grading on K-16 students, with 3 impacts: \u201cGrades tend to diminish students\u2019 interest in whatever they\u2019re learning&#8230;Grades create a preference for the easiest possible task&#8230;Grades tend to reduce the quality of students\u2019 thinking.\u201d Along the same line, Daniel Pink, in his book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, argues that while many consider grades to be a motivating factor for students,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cFor artists, scientists, inventors, schoolchildren, and the rest of us, intrinsic motivation\u2014the drive to do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing\u2014is essential for high levels of creativity.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The key to having a positive impact on student motivation, Pink suggests, is instilling autonomy, mastery and purpose into learning activities. The function of grades as a representation of student learning has also been called into question. In the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.deefinkandassociates.com\/GuidetoCourseDesignAug05.pdf\">Self-Directed Guide to Designing Courses for Significant Learning<\/a>, Dee Fink draws this distinction by outlining the difference between \u201caudit-ive\u201d and \u201ceducative\u201d assessment. Fink explains that \u201cAudit-ive assessment is designed solely to give the teacher a basis for awarding a grade\u201d (p. 13). In contrast, educative assessment is forward-looking, and incorporates self-assessment and frequent and timely feedback. The goal of educative assessment is to support students\u2019 learning journey and to give them feedback on their process.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, grading can present an equity issue, <a href=\"https:\/\/classtrouble.club\/blogs\/resonance-archives\/a-guide-to-coded-language-in-education-vol-i\">particularly when tied to the discourse of rigor<\/a>; as the authors of A Guide to Coded Language in Education write, \u201cRigor itself isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing \u2015 but when combined with grading it becomes a tool to create classroom meritocracy. In this way rigor is wielded as an extension of the carceral state, to punish struggling students by creating failure where growth might otherwise exist.\u201d This critique of the discourse of rigor, and the way that rigor is used in classrooms, ties directly to the previous point about the purposes of assessment in our classrooms, where grades are used to sort (audit-ive assessment) rather than support (educative assessment).<\/p>\n<p>While conversations about the purpose and practice of grading are not new, we suggest that the calls for rethinking grading in Spring 2020 have the potential to spur an ongoing rethinking and reorientation. There have always been some students in our classes who have faced the challenges that all of our students faced in the spring of 2020. There have always been students in our classes with health or travel issues that have prevented them from attending in person classes. The difference was that in the spring of 2020, all of our students faced these challenges, so institutions were forced to make a change.\u00a0 Moving forward, we are in a position to ask the question, what practices should we reorient? How should we adjust our teaching, learning and work to recognize and include those facing circumstances that are not the \u201cdefault\u201d situation? How can we ensure that no one feels alone in asking for what they need?\u00a0 How might we simplify and streamline the process of assessment to incorporate a focus on learning coupled with flexibility?<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, promising alternatives to traditional grading have emerged in the form of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jessestommel.com\/ungrading-a-bibliography\/\">ungrading<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hastac.org\/blogs\/cathy-davidson\/2015\/08\/16\/getting-started-6-contract-grading-and-peer-review\">contract grading<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/ii.library.jhu.edu\/2018\/04\/11\/what-is-specifications-grading-and-why-should-you-consider-using-it\/\">specifications grading<\/a>, to name a few approaches. These approaches have in common a view of the role of assessment as supporting student growth (i.e., educative assessment), and a participatory approach to assessment, where students are invited into the process of determining how their growth in learning should be represented. Asking students to reflect on their learning and apply metacognitive strategies improves learning outcomes in addition to giving students more ownership and autonomy over their learning process.<\/p>\n<p>Susan Blum notes in her book <a href=\"https:\/\/wvupressonline.com\/node\/844\">Ungrading: Why Rating Students Undermines Learning (and What to Do Instead<\/a>, \u201cThough grading seems natural, inevitable, a part of the very fabric of school, it isn\u2019t. It was created at a certain moment, for certain reasons not entirely thought out, and then became embedded in the structures of school for most students\u201d (p. 2). As with any system created by humans, there are inherited problems in grading systems that are important to consider as we re-envision what our grading practices could look like. Some students and parents will seek to maintain the grading status quo from an internalized belief that grades are the end goal of education; how will we equitably manage those inquiries? Also, we note that when students are asked to self-evaluate, we need to consider how confidence, a sense of self, and past experience plays a role in a students\u2019 view of their own work. In<a href=\"https:\/\/hybridpedagogy.org\/grading-during-covid\/\"> their article in Hybrid Pedagogy<\/a>, Laura Tanenbaum and Kristin Gallagher point out, \u201cMany low-income, first-generation, and students of color are vulnerable to doubting their ability. These students question their place at the university and show a tendency to take any negative feedback as a sign that they shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d Finally, we need to consider our own implicit biases when evaluating students. Although we\u2019d like to pretend they don\u2019t exist, <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/3705454\/teachers-biases-girls-education\/\">we know they are there.<\/a> For example, do you tend to view written assignments as being more rigorous than others? What impact does this have on your evaluations of student work?<\/p>\n<p>Although shifting the way we grade can be challenging, particularly within an institutional setting and structure that continues to orient itself toward traditional approaches to grading, we believe that there is enough evidence to prove that traditional grading systems amplify inequities in a way that requires us to seriously interrogate our grading practices and assess how well they align with institutional vision and mission. If we truly want students to lead <a href=\"http:\/\/www.middlebury.edu\/about\/mission\">\u201c&#8230;engaged, consequential and creative lives\u2026\u201d<\/a> should we evaluate their work through a system that limits engagement and creativity? Obviously these aren\u2019t easy questions to answer, but that does not mean we should avoid them. As teachers we must continually ask more of ourselves for our students to ensure that we are in alignment with the change we wish to see.<\/p>\n<h3>Take Action<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Investigate some of the practices shared in the article <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/advice\/2020\/05\/06\/changes-instructors-should-consider-administering-and-grading-exams-during-covid\">Equitable Exams During COVID-19<\/a>, and consider implementing these practices in future courses once we are past the pandemic<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Consider building more tasks into fewer assessments.

Our office had been tracking the developments leading up to the strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) by Proctorio against Ian Linkletter, a learning technology specialist at the University of British Columbia. Ian is being sued because he spoke out against the Proctorio platform over Twitter, supporting his critiques by sharing links to openly available video Youtube documentation which the company claims were proprietary. By definition a SLAPP suit is designed to silence and intimidate critics with the burden of funding a legal defense. The teach-in organizers facilitated a series of provocations, discussion and presentations addressing the daily presence and harms of surveillance technologies in and outside of higher education settings and importantly asking questions like, \u201cHow do we as educators help to make our students aware of the differences between surveillance and care? How can we make other faculty we teach with aware of these differences and bring these differences to the forefront in educational technology systems where we&#8217;re encouraged to confuse surveillance with care?<\/p>\n<p>In response to and in the spirit of the teach-in, for this detox we offer a collection of brief reflections from those of us in DLINQ who were able to attend the event. We hope these might encourage you to notice, reflect, and consider taking action to stand up against systems that surveil, and in their place advocate for and build digital learning spaces, technologies, and practices that are more <a href=\"http:\/\/www.consentfultech.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Building-Consentful-Tech.pdf\">consentful<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amy\u2019s reflection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Teach-In provided much-needed reminders about how harmful surveillance of our students can be and how antithetical surveillance is to the ethic of care for our students. What sticks with me from those conversations, and especially Audrey Watters\u2019 remarks, is how harmful these technologies can be to university\/college faculty and staff, especially those who are in precarious positions (e.g., staff, non-tenured or contingent faculty). The lawsuit against Ian is a horrific reminder of the repercussions faculty and staff face when they call attention to concerns about privacy, data misuse, and surveillance of students. Lawsuits like Proctorio\u2019s are intended to have this chilling effect&#8211;to keep concerned faculty, staff, and students quiet and compliant. Like other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.carceral.tech\/why\">carceral technologies<\/a>, companies like Proctorio aim to control their users and their critics using coercion, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brlamb\/status\/1319101036296953858\">intimidation<\/a>, and yes, threats of legal action that allow them to <a href=\"https:\/\/web.hypothes.is\/blog\/in-defense-of-ian-linkletter\/\">flex their wealth and emperil the livelihoods of folks like Ian<\/a>. This is unacceptable and all the more reason why WE DON\u2019T NEED THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR SCHOOLS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bob\u2019s reflection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The pandemic-induced emergency shift to remote teaching this past year left little room for reflection on the impacts that our heavy and oftentimes unexamined reliance on enterprise technologies and platforms has had on us. The Teach-in #Against Surveillance demonstrated for me the urgency and potential for engaging our collective imaginations and authority to reject exploitative technologies and teaching practices that dehumanize students or undermine the deeply relational project of teaching and learning. For me, the teach-in has helped to further normalize the use of the word <i>surveillance<\/i> in framings of education technologies. When I think of surveillance words like policing, invasive, punitive, enemy, fear, power, danger, defensive, pervasive, secret, military, trauma come to mind. In response, as technologists, instructional designers, and decision-makers we must continue to, as Jenny Odell suggests, \u201chold open the space of refusal\u201d (How to Do Nothing, p.77) whether it be technological or pedagogical. We need to commit ourselves to the slow and reflective path of humanizing teaching and learning whether on the ground in classroom, hybrid, or fully online contexts. The pandemic has made clear that we need to look beyond the surface of our tools and question our practices to make room for classroom technologies and pedagogies built on an ethic of care like those promoted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.niu.edu\/movingforward\/resources\/principles-for-trauma-informed-teaching.shtml\">trauma informed teaching and learning<\/a>: safety, trustworthiness and transparency; support and connection; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment through voice and choice; cultural, historical and gender lenses; resilience, growth and change. As Benjamin Doxdator, one of the teach-in panelists reflected, \u201c\u2026every time we give up the kind of back and forth reciprocity with our [students] and hand it over to systems of surveillance we lose deep and important pedagogical moments.\u201d Reciprocity here echoes the principle of mutuality, of presence, and of being seen and heard as whole human beings. It is remarkable that Ian\u2019s legal defense <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/f\/stand-against-proctorio\/share\">Gofundme<\/a> has raised over $50,000 to date. It shouldn\u2019t have to be this way!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Steven\u2019s reflection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when I agreed to attend the surveillance teach-in, but I left inspired by the conversation. Unlike other digital events, this thrummed with energy and vigorous exchange. I appreciated the structures the group used to break down established power structures, and that it centered the concerns of students by answering our questions first. It filled me with a sense of empowerment, respect, and care that is often missing in these discussions.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many questions signaled to me that students across the country are fighting battles that have already been lost. They asked how they could get universities to roll back surveillance technology or how they could opt out. Few, if any, focused on how we could preempt our institutions from considering surveillance technology in the first place. Since then I\u2019ve wondered why we assume a reactionary stance instead of a proactive stance?<\/p>\n<p>One thing that stands out to me is that many people still believe they can neatly bifurcate their on and offlives. Many still consider technology and the internet as add-ons when they are very much essential. Our digital bodies are important, and we must endow them with just as much respect and care as we do our physical bodies. By reconceptualizing the importance of our onlife, we will advocate for it before it comes under threat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Joe\u2019s reflection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two of my daughters are in college, so when we transitioned to remote learning I found myself observing their experiences. It was an opportunity to see the impact of the choices that instructors make when designing activities for their courses. My reflection on the Teach-in is connected to an experience one of my daughters had with a final exam.<\/p>\n<p>During the weeks leading up to the exam time I watched as my daughter\u2019s anxiety increased. All of us, my wife, her sister, and I, all knew the day and time because she had asked us to not be online during the exam.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cYou will need to make sure you have proper internet connection for the duration of the exam.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>She planned where she would be sitting, choosing a spot close to the router with good lighting, paying attention to what was going to be behind her.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cYou need to make sure you have a functional camera on your device that allows me to see you clearly during the test.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The material was already going to be challenging. During this exam she would be observed by people, some of them she could and could not see, and she would be recorded.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u201cThere will be several people proctoring the exam\u2026 They will not necessarily have their cameras on, but they will be monitoring with me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the day of the exam she paced around until the starting time. She spent the next two hours with her eyes on the screen as her camera recorded her answering each question one by one. She would never see her answers, only a score.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of stories like this, in some the student\u2019s home environment adds to the anxiety of being watched. Their internet connection is spotty, their living space does not have an optimal location, and they have siblings and pets that do not know that they need to be quiet during a specific time. The disruptions, the invasions into their living space, are recorded and reviewed, stored on a stranger\u2019s server.<\/p>\n<p>Students pay money for an education, why do we give that money to a company whose purpose adds stress to an already stressful situation? Is this really in service of our students? And is it ethical to work with a company that uses that money to sue a colleague who is acting with a similar purpose: holding them accountable for their practices?<\/p>\n<h2><strong><span class=\"e2ma-style\">Take Action<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage students, faculty, and staff to stand up together against proctoring technologies &#8211;

surveillance of students"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>by Dr. Sarah Payne, Instructional Designer, DLINQ<\/p>\n<p>By now many of us are familiar with the ways the coronavirus pandemic has affected teaching and learning, for better and for worse. One of the most egregious trends to emerge from pandemic pedagogy is the use and expansion of online proctoring software. Companies such as Proctorio, HonorLock, and ProctorU use artificial intelligence, remote proctors, or both to surveill students while they take exams. The software requires students to enable webcams and microphones during the exam so that any suspicious behavior can be flagged as potential cheating. Incriminating actions can include looking away from the computer too frequently, leaving the room, or the presence of someone else. Instructors can then review flagged students to determine if cheating occurred.<\/p>\n<p>Though levels of academic dishonesty in online courses are often <a title=\"NYT article on online testing\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/05\/10\/us\/online-testing-cheating-universities-coronavirus.html\" data-name=\"similar to their in-person counterparts\" data-type=\"url\">similar to their in-person counterparts<\/a>, that\u2019s not what these ed tech companies would have you believe.

However, as scholars such as <a title=\"Ruha Benjamin\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rY8RkET3KC0\" data-name=\"Ruha Benjamin\" data-type=\"url\">Ruha Benjamin<\/a>, <a title=\"Safiya Noble\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iRVZozEEWlE\" data-name=\"Safiya Noble\" data-type=\"url\">Safiya Noble<\/a>, and others have noted, technology and algorithms are rife with bias and enable exploitation and abuse. In order for the software to flag suspicious behavior, it must be taught what \u201cnormal\u201d behavior looks like. Deviations from that baseline are then coded as suspicious. Of course, \u201csuspicious\u201d is not a neutral term, but one built on implicit and explicit biases. It should come as no surprise then that <a title=\"Our Bodies Encoded\" href=\"https:\/\/hybridpedagogy.org\/our-bodies-encoded-algorithmic-test-proctoring-in-higher-education\/\" data-name=\"what the software recognizes as normal is often white, able-bodied, neurotypical, and cisgender\" data-type=\"url\">what the software recognizes as normal is often white, able-bodied, neurotypical, and cisgender<\/a>.

If we view students as adversaries bent on cheating the system, then of course we\u2019d want to surveil them to catch their inevitable dishonesty. But students aren\u2019t our adversaries and they deserve compassion, now more than ever. Rather than engaging in punitive pedagogy, we might instead start from a place of trust and care for our students. We can listen to them when they express confusion, frustration, or distress about educational technologies and support them by creating meaningful assessments that don\u2019t cause harm. Though proctoring software companies cast student assessment during the pandemic as a technical problem in need of a technical solution, this is instead a pedagogical question that demands a pedagogical answer.

In most places, this meant that continuity of instruction relied on technology, specifically, Internet-enabled devices such as tablets and laptops.

This reliance on technology shone a bright light on existing issues that students face in being able to equitably access their education.

Low-income students experience more barriers to participating in remote learning than their wealthier peers; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2020\/09\/10\/59-of-u-s-parents-with-lower-incomes-say-their-child-may-face-digital-obstacles-in-schoolwork\/\">a Pew Internet survey found<\/a> that \u201croughly 6 in 10 parents with lower incomes said it\u2019s likely their homebound children would face at least one digital obstacle to doing their schoolwork.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The shift to remote learning during the pandemic laid bare the range of barriers and challenges our students face at Middlebury as well. During the transition to emergency remote learning in the spring of 2020, a special task force was created to help address these challenges. The task force sometimes pointed students to IT for support for access to hardware and software, sometimes to financial services, sometimes the Disability Resource Center, sometimes to mental health support services. <a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/dlinq-news\/what-is-asynchronous-and-why-do-you-keep-recommending-it-to-me\/\">DLINQ made recommendations to faculty<\/a> who were transitioning their courses that were focused on helping students who lived in distant time zones, who didn\u2019t have robust internet access, or perhaps who needed more flexibility to complete assignments due to challenges in their new living environments (for many students, that meant being back at home, but for some students, it meant living on a friend\u2019s couch or sleeping in their car). This work was responsive to what we were hearing from students about the hardships they were facing, but it was also largely ad hoc, and there were certainly students who fell through the cracks of the support we were trying to offer.<\/p>\n<p>As we think about moving away from emergency- and pandemic-based remote education, we need to carry forward what we\u2019ve learned about the barriers our students face, whether or not our students continue to take classes in online modalities. For example, after the transition to remote learning, many faculty have expressed excitement about video technologies that can support learning in their face-to-face classes going forward. Digital textbooks promise exciting features like social annotation and interactive simulations. Yet as we explore educational innovations made possible by a wider technology adoption among faculty, we should carefully consider the downstream impacts on equity for our students and proactively ensure equity at the course level and institutional level. With increased use of video in a class, we need commitments from faculty and support from institutions to ensure that videos are captioned, available and understandable in audio-only format, and fully accessible to students on a variety of devices and with varying levels of internet access. With adoption of digital textbooks, we need commitments from faculty and support from institutions to adopt low- or no-cost digital textbooks that allow students to retain the digital copies beyond the class (i.e., openly licensed textbooks).<\/p>\n<p>We can approach this work with hope&#8211;hope that with a more widespread recognition of the challenges that students face in accessing their education, we can start to address long-standing inequities in education at a larger scale. And, tackling these issues requires commitment and conviction, because they can be time-consuming and expensive&#8211;making accessible videos is expensive and time consuming; finding open educational resources is time-consuming. Institutions need to be ready to invest financial and human resources into supporting systemic changes that lead to greater equity.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Take Action<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Deepen your understanding of accessibility and identify small moves that you can take to make your digital materials accessible<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/doit\/20-tips-teaching-accessible-online-course\">20 Tips for Teaching an Accessible Online Course\u2028<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sheribyrnehaber.medium.com\/ten-things-to-improve-conference-call-accessibility-4af6db5c8104\">10 Things to Improve Conference Call Accessibility<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapping-access.com\/blog-1\/2020\/3\/10\/accessible-teaching-in-the-time-of-covid-19\">Accessible Teaching in a Time of COVID\u2028<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/digital-inclusion\/creating-accessible-digital-materials\/\">Creating Accessible Digital Materials<\/a><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/digital-literacy\/digital-detox-2-8-universal-design-for-learning-and-accessibility\/\">Digital Detox 2.8: Universal Design for Learning and Accessibility<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Join communities focused on equity in education, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/unboundeq.creativitycourse.org\/\">Equity Unbound founded by Maha Bali, Catherine Cronin, and Mia Zamora<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/hope4college.com\/\">Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice founded by Sara Goldrick-Rab<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><b>Keep reading!<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/education\/the-switch-to-remote-learning-could-leave-students-with-disabilities-behind\">The Switch to Remote Learning Could Leave Students with Disabilities Behind<\/a>, PBS<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/news\/2020\/04\/06\/remote-learning-shift-leaves-students-disabilities-behind\">Accessibility Suffers During Pandemic<\/a>, Inside Higher Ed<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/er.educause.edu\/articles\/2020\/10\/inclusive-design-and-design-justice-strategies-to-shape-our-classes-and-communities\">Inclusive Design and Design Justice: Strategies to Shape Our Classes and Communities<\/a>, Amy Collier<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>by Dr. Sarah Lohnes Watulak, Director of Digital Pedagogy and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":21542,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[93],"tags":[146,358],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/21540"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/6"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=21540"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/21540\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":21543,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/21540\/revisions\/21543"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/21542"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=21540"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=21540"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=21540"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":21529,"date":"2021-01-13T10:04:04","date_gmt":"2021-01-13T18:04:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/?p=21529"},"modified":"2021-01-13T10:04:04","modified_gmt":"2021-01-13T18:04:04","slug":"digital-detox-2021-1-infodemic-mis-disinformation-in-the-age-of-covid","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/dlinq.middcreate.net\/blog\/2021\/01\/13\/digital-detox-2021-1-infodemic-mis-disinformation-in-the-age-of-covid\/","title":{"rendered":"Digital Detox 2021\/1: Infodemic!

We need more of this&#8211;the events at the Capitol last week underscore how dangerous mis\/disinformation can be, not just to our health and safety, but to a functioning civil society.

BIPOC communities and low-income communities are being ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of digital mis\/disinformation exacerbates this problem by deepening mistrust of medical professionals and treatments among these groups, who may already be skeptical due to a \u201c<a title=\"Quote from Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith\" href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/news\/us\/biden-e2-80-99s-health-equity-adviser-on-her-approach-to-addressing-the-politicization-of-covid-and-misinformation\/ar-BB1cC0pU\" data-type=\"url\" data-name=\"long history of medical mistreatment and ongoing lived experiences of systemic racism in health care today\">long history of medical mistreatment and ongoing lived experiences of systemic racism in health care today<\/a><span class=\"e2ma-style\">.<\/span>\u201d (see also this <a title=\"Fortune article\" href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2020\/12\/17\/covid-vaccine-skepticism-black-community\" data-type=\"url\" data-name=\"Fortune article\">Fortune article<\/a>; similarly, we also see <a title=\"Election disinformation and communities of color\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3TY63za4Qmg\" data-type=\"url\" data-name=\"election disinformation targeting communities of color\">election disinformation targeting communities of color<\/a> to discourage them from voting).

Our inattention to those harms exacerbates them.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I know that&#8217;s a hard statement to swallow, especially if privilege has shielded you from these harms. But unless we come to terms with this reality, marginalized folks and communities will continue to face the harshest impacts of this pandemic, including the differential impacts caused by or related to digital technologies, platforms, and the web.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen many examples of how the pandemic exposed and exacerbated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.govtech.com\/network\/How-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Shed-Light-on-the-Digital-Divide.html\">the real digital divide<\/a>&#8211;not between younger people and older people (which is often how the digital divide is characterized)&#8211;but between folks who have access to reliable, affordable, and safe digital technologies and platforms and those who do not.<\/p>\n<p>As an educator, I&#8217;ve been particularly attuned to the equity and inclusion issues the pandemic has caused for students. It&#8217;s heartbreaking to hear and read stories about young people who sat outside of restaurants and cafes to use their free WiFi to be able to complete their coursework. That isn&#8217;t just a hardship, it&#8217;s a harm. Through open WiFi networks, those students are exposed to horrific privacy and data violations. They are harmed in their learning&#8211;<a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/human-interest\/calif-students-internet-hotspot-taco-bells-wifi\/\">sitting outside a Taco Bell to do class work,<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wbur.org\/edify\/2020\/05\/08\/pandemic-learning-without-internet\">from a car<\/a>, is harmful to learning.<\/p>\n<p>We read and hear stories of students facing invasive intrusions and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wbur.org\/cognoscenti\/2019\/11\/12\/robo-grading-rich-barlow\">biases<\/a> from online proctoring companies used for remote assessment proctoring and grading. Automated proctoring software flags &#8220;suspicious&#8221; behavior it associates with cheating but can sometimes flag non-cheating behaviors like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/09\/29\/style\/testing-schools-proctorio.html\">moving your mouth while reading<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/hybridpedagogy.org\/our-bodies-encoded-algorithmic-test-proctoring-in-higher-education\/\">having ADHD<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/uhreeb\/status\/1303139738065481728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1304451031066083331%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F09%2F29%2Fstyle%2Ftesting-schools-proctorio.html\">having darker skin.<\/a> This isn&#8217;t just a hardship, it&#8217;s a harm.

It will provide resources, readings, and strategies to consider as we try to negotiate and reverse the harms caused by the pandemic&#8217;s digital push.
