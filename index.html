		      <p>
		        As we launch our fifth year of the Digital Detox, DLINQ is venturing into a less familiar space for our digital learning experts—how digital learning and technologies impact the Earth and our relationship with it.

		        We will turn often to climate experts to help us make sense of our wonderings and questions. We will also look to you, our readers, to share your expertise on these topics. We invite you to join us on these ventures into the intersections and impacts of technology and digital learning on environmental issues and action, and to share your thoughts via (insert details here).
